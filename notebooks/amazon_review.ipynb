After several unsuccessful attempts to reach Amazon (with no accessible customer service contact numbers or direct support options), I was forced to contact the third-party seller directly. The seller assured me that the product had been dispatched on time and advised me to resolve the issue with Amazon. Despite being provided with a phone number that I could not find anywhere on Amazon’s platform, I eventually managed to speak with an Amazon representative. I was informed that the product had been lost, and while a refund was issued, the real issue remains unresolved.I need the material, not just a refund. When I attempted to reorder the product, I discovered that the price had increased by $150 — an unjustifiable increase given the circumstances. I explained the situation to the representative, emphasizing that I had already quoted my customer the original price and could not go back to them with an unexplained price hike. In summary, my experience with Amazon has been one of misleading pricing, unreliable delivery, and a lack of customer support.

It just so happens that UPS only keeps tracking records for 120 days. Well Amazon is trying to collect on a dispute that my bank closed-out in my favor about 456 days later. Their account specialist randomly acted like it was a new dispute, even though it\\'s from more than a year ago. I haven\\'t made any returns for the last seven months, and recently made two returns, so I think Amazon is trying to retaliate against me for no reason other than that this is their latest maneuver to try and goad me into rethinking legitimate returns.Background on Dispute: This item was confirmed through UPS back then as having arrived at an Amazon facility. Amazon resisted against refunding me, citing that the item never arrived, contrary to clear evidence at the time. Chase Bank resolved things in my favor after I produced all the evidence. I have none of it on hand anymore, as this was a closed matter in my eyes, especially 456 days after the fact.I have filed complaints with the FTC, the BBB, and am working on a state attorney general complaint, after Amazon sends over my request archive of data. I am not going to allow a billion dollar company to bully me over a $16.91 dispute.

I had an order that was out for delivery, then it kept being delayed until I was told it would arrive by 10pm, then it was delayed by two days, and the same thing just happened but this time delayed by four days. How can an order be OUT FOR DELIVERY and then end up being delayed by days?2. The refund system. I was told by an automated service that I'd be refunded for said cases above, but the system then told me I'd be refunded once the items are returned. I contacted one of the agents and questioned how can I return something that didn't arrive, and thankfully they agreed and refunded me.

Tough Light never responded to a message I left them and after sending an email expressing the diverse issues, there position was that in order to return and replace I needed to have proof of purchase. I know that every product sold has a unique number and ToughLight could have easily verified if the product I have was sold through Amazon m. That ended the story! However, the Eton Radio was not charging properly solar or with furnished plug to charge in an electrical outlet. The response was 180 degrees from Amazon and ToughLight!

       " \"While I've generally been pleased with the products I've purchased from Amazon, their handling of product reviews is incredibly frustrating. Recently, I invested my time to write thoughtful and positive reviews for two separate products, only to have Amazon remove them without a clear explanation. The communication I received indicated a violation of their community guidelines, though these guidelines are so extensive that it's unreasonable to expect customers to sift through them to determine the precise issue.This isn't just a minor annoyance; it directly affects the sellers whose high-quality products are worthy of praise, but now lack the positive feedback they have earned due to a seemingly capricious review system. Further aggravating the situation is the unhelpful customer service that provides no meaningful guidance on correcting the supposed issues with my reviews.Despite my appreciation for the value of the products I purchased, the deficient and opaque review process, coupled with a customer service team that gives no definitive answers, has led me to the point of exasperation. Consequently, I am no longer inclined to dedicate my time to crafting new reviews. Instead, I find myself compelled to voice my discontent here. Amazon, unfortunately, has earned this negative feedback due to their lackluster service and unfavorable approach to customer and seller relations.\",\n",

       " \"I cannot believe that I am actually moved to call AMAZON a bunch of SCAMMERS.  I placed an order for an item yesterday evening.  It was on a price offer until midnight and would be delivered the next day (today).  I just happened to look at my orders and saw that it would, now, not be delivered for another TWENTY FOUR DAYS.  On the order page, I clicked on the image of the item - read that again slowly, ON THE  ORDER  PAGE,  I  CLICKED  ON  THE  IMAGE  OF  THE  ITEM  and it took me back to it, SHOWING THAT I HAD BOUGHT IT THE DAY BEFORE but it was now back to its original price AND WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY.  I called amazon to query this and was told that I could cancel the order re-place it and my item would arrive the next day.  But, of course, I would have to pay the higher price.  No amount of arguing seemed to be able to answer the question of how EXACTLY the same item can be delivered next day at the higher price, but at the offer price I paid the previous day I would have to wait over three weeks.  Insanity.  I demanded to speak to the agent's supervisor and, after more arguing, I was put through.  The supervisor, after more arguing and trying to get through to him the ridiculousness of the situation, was magnanimous enough to offer me the difference in a gift card if I cancelled and re-placed the order.  I don't want an effing gift card, I want the item at the price I paid and with the delivery time advertised on the listing at the time I paid for it.  Is that too much to ask?  What they did, by anyone's definition, was a SCAM and I have now deleted my account.\",\n",
       " 'I used to like Amazon a lot, in their early years they couldn\\'t be beat because of their quality of service, but things have really changed in my opinion, and they keep getting worse.For the 3rd time this year I\\'ve had an order get delayed.  I understand that that\\'s part of mail-ordering... but there\\'s always somethings that are \"hinky\" about the delays. For instance, I received a confirmation 20 hours ago that the items had just shipped and that I could expect them today. Just now, I received a delay notice that it \"should\" arrive in 5 days. (How did it get delayed overnight?) And the other delays were similarly nonsensical.I\\'ve worked in shipping & receiving positions a lot, in my career days, so I get that odd things can happen, in fact odd can be rather normal in the \"business\". So, I\\'m unconvinced that the reasons behind any of my recent delayed shipments were the \"normal sort of odd\".The thing with Amazon and their sellers is that there\\'s a rather long waiting period when an item gets delayed before they\\'ll consider it lost and grant a refund or whatever. Also, they don\\'t take the loss/delay seriously like they used to do back in the day. And to add to that, there\\'s really no place on the Amazon site to comment about their site (as if they care about the customer) ... I\\'ve always hated looking at the reviews about an item, only to read about shipping issues... now I understand why.So, a month or so ago, I quit Amazon Prime because paying for better shipping privileges when the shipping services were cruddy didn\\'t make sense.

This time the seller would not respond after 48hours. Again I was told it would be taken care of. The next day I got an email telling me the breadmaker was stolen and I would have to get a police report to them I stressed that I had several conversations with them already about this breadmaker and it was not stolen.  The next day I received the same email saying I need the police report.  I called again. This time in complete frustration. A john came on and then said I would need to deal with the seller to resolve now. Or he could put a certain percentage on my Amazon account if I kept the breadmaker.  What???

It’s ridiculous. Why would you place any more orders with a company? If they’re not going to deliver it? I don’t think they understand the concept.. sadly their customer services got worse that I didn’t think it could get. I had to repeat myself to the person nine times and he still didn’t seem to understand that I had a pending payment which means I sadly could not access my money and was told by the bank that I needed a code from him so it could be cancelled or they could cancel it for me either way he refused to do it. He said I just had to ring my bank like I haven’t done that numerous times before now. I have money that I can’t even get to sat there pending. I hate Amazon and I will never use them again they are disgusting. I even asked him if I could put a complaint in because I don’t think he understood when I said I needed the payment pending cancelled. I want to close the account and I cannot do that until this is done. I would never order from this company ever again because now they’re holding my money and I can’t even get to it my bank said without an authorisation code they could not close it themselves so I had to ring Amazon and get them to do it directly which they are refusing to do so my money is just sat there in limbo sadly unimpressed quite wound up and my birthday is tomorrow.

However fake reviews abound and there are a lot of scams, some obvious, which they don't seem too keen to root out - for example: any number of SD cards which trick your computer or phone into thinking it has a terabyte or even more of extra memory but really only has a fraction of that, and which corrupt your files when the real limit is reached. I decided to part company with Amazon when their customer service department contradicted itself, claiming that my account could not be restored when just the previous evening someone from the accounts department had been on the verge of doing precisely that, lacking only immediate access to my email for verification (unfortunately I was away from my computer at the time). I was told I now needed to set up a new account, but in doing so I now stand to lose several years of accumulated Kindle books. On account of this dire, confused and unhelpful customer service and the prevalence of scams and fakery I can only rate Amazon at 2 stars even though you can buy anything there and the app is easy to use.

I have a few experiences LAST YEAR: I do Christmas shopping early, and I homeschool so my kids are with me all the time and well i thought Amazon would be convenient source. Upon going through my packages, i had noticed i was sold used boys underwear, I usually use the chat option and the girl started to interrogate me and said i had to send a photo of my license, i was like no, so i called instantly and I got this girl and she said no, and “supposedly” gave me 50 promo to repurchase the underwear, well…. It never got added to my account, never i went through associate after associate, one in which screamed so loudly at me and blamed me of lying and then hung up, finally i got this girl who said i had used it, so I asked her on what she goes a toolbox for a back of a truck it was used in part of that order, i assured her that i indeed did not own a truck…. And that my account must of been hacked, i got through associate after associate, nothing was done at all, in fact the Hanes company themselves refunded me for the underwear sent me replacements, i did get a call from there higher up office and they have me a $50 gift balance, well ok it gets even better, i get my son a gaming laptop $800, the seller was very unreasonable, the associate promised it was A-Z well needless to say we had to send this laptop out and have if fixed $400 in extra damages, finally after i complained so much they wrote us a letter to dispute he charges on our card, after that i bought some leggings, there was a whole in the leggings, the associate said I must of been so heavy i stretched them out and i could not get a refund.  Half of the items i got last year were either not as described by the sellers or just used and retaped back up and sold as new. Then they sold me a pairs of winter boots, and there was white power all over them i complained about those too….i sent items back and didn’t get a return they kept it numerous times, i had to involve the bbb to get anywheres Well this year i decided nope no way am i going to deal with Amazon, well i found a wahl clipper set i paid $200 for this set, it took a gouge of skin out of my husbands head, amazon refused to refund me because i was one day over the deadline. I had to go to bbb for that i just sent it back and finally they did refund me after a fight, but they wanted me to contact the company,So i decided well I’m going to go to Walmart for know on they have all the same items and it will be much easier to return if necessary, but with dread a few items Walmart did not have so I had to purchase with Amazon, i ordered a camera bundle for 141.58 it came with accessories, well upon opening my back there’s no accessories, so well i thought ill deal with the seller, usually there earlier they will just send what’s missing, i talk to the seller and he’s just unreasonable, saying he can’t send it because it will cost him money. Like no reason at all, well with complete dread i chat with amazon and speak with an agent named Joey Mae, he was polite and gave me two options 1. I return for a replacement, or 2, they give me half a refund to my original payment method. I chose option 2, he said id get a email…… well waiting no email, then another agents said the same thing, no email, then the 3rd said they approved it and ill be getting back 64.58 and i should get a email. I got a email there like return it for 141.58 for a full refund and you’ll have to repurchase the item, so i wrote back and said there must be a mistake and told them and shared the screenshots i took, because i had one to many ptsd experiences, there like no we have to take this to a higher level. So i called and got this English lady who screams at me has me on hold for 20mins and just comes back yelling. I wrote to the highest up, and they still didn’t budge even with the screen shots as proof, so i took it to the bbb, and still will not budge, so I’m out 141.58. Also they sold me toy in the same order that was used and the amount of dust on it was so thick you could write your name in it, and it was stabbed repeated over and over again with something sharp, i was able to send photos of that and they replaced that and told me to keep and donate the other one.They changed there return policy around know they use a QR code and you take your item to the ups store and they scan it do all the packaging, I live in a rural area, the nearest ups store is 2 hours away, and you have to pay $7.99 to print your own label, and $14.99 to have ups pick up at your door. We have little ups mailbox at a gas station but it’s for small items.

       " '   Amazon customer service has sunk to new depths.  It seems the general approach is to throw out random explanations, no matter how untrue,  and hope one of them sticks.  Writing to executives is not helpful, as they just throw your issue to some Executive Response team, manned by the same low competence.    My issue stems from a google play gift card order via Amazon for an important birthday.  Two days after the order was accepted, and on the day the gift card was due to be delivered, it was arbitrarily cancelled.    The following saga ensues as I repeatedly contact customer service with two simple questions:  Why was the order cancelled and who cancelled it-  Agent says it was damaged in transit .... it’s an electronic gift card -  Same agent says I cancelled the order .... this is not the case -  Same agent says they can’t track anything as the order is over 30 days old .... the order was placed 5 days earlier -  The supervisor can’t figure out what happened and promises a response within 48 hours .... no response was ever received -  I escalate to CS-escalation and am told “not our problem, talk to the marketplace vendor for a refund.” ... refund was not the issue -  I escalate up the executive chain and i receive a response saying the payment was rejected by my bank.   I proceed to demonstrate that payment was in fact taken but reimbursed two days later  ... so not a rejection from the bank -  A different agent agrees that it was not a payment rejection and promises a response by Aug 20 ... I receive a response Aug 22-  The response states “an error on our end processing this refund” ... refund was not the issue  In short, terrible customer service and executives who don’t care about your experience.   Amazon has grown too big and indolent to care about quality.  It will cost them as more customers previously loyal, such as I, shift their purchasing to other more competent avenues.',\n",

       " 'I have a surgery scheduled for August 16th and need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before. I have been trying to order clear protein drinks for two weeks now, and Amazon has so far failed to deliver all of them. The first product was 5 days shipping and the day before delivery the shipper broke some of the bottles--not Amazon\\'s fault, obviously. The problem was how Amazon handled it. When I called, they told me they communicated to the company to initiate the replacement now, so it could be delivered  by the following Saturday. By the next day I still did not see a status change on the Amazon app for the product, so I called again--I was told by the person that she \"guaranteed\" I would receive the replacement by Saturday. Saturday arrived and still no change in shipping status to indicate the item was shipped--in fact, the only update was to state I was receiving a refund--so I called Amazon again. The first agent lied to me and tried to tell me he could \"help\" by initiating a refund (the refund had already been initiated the day before). I had the call escalated and I was told the item was never replaced and that none of the agents should have told me what they did. It was also too late to order that item as new orders would arrive after the surgery date. I looked for a different clear protein drink (that isn\\'t red or purple). By now the surgery was only a few days away. The item I found indicated it could be delivered same day, between 5 and 10 p.m. Eureka, I thought. I ordered it. Of course it didn\\'t arrive. That night the app updated to say that it would be delivered by 8 a.m. the next day. It wasn\\'t. I called Amazon again. This time they have no idea why the item wasn\\'t delivered and they still had no idea if or when the item might be delivered today. I had the call escalated. She didn\\'t know either. She also couldn\\'t reach the area that handles shipping to find out when the item would be shipped. She ended up refunding the first item (while not canceling it) and recommending a new order be put in to try to get the item delivered by this afternoon--halfway through the clear liquids day. I did as she suggested and put the second order it, but I really have very little confidence  Amazon can make it happen anymore. Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of failed and late deliveries with this company. It\\'s become commonplace. While I was on the phone with the escalation team, I submitted my order for the first items I am moving to Walmart and away from Amazon. I will find replacements for the rest of my items and then cancel Prime before the end of the month. For those who may be holding off on canceling Prime because you like the streaming, be aware that after you cancel you can pay for a streaming-only option for $9 a month--less than the $15 a month or so we pay for Prime shipping. If I find the streaming worth keeping (TBD), that is what I will switch to. The rest of the company isn\\'t worth my hard-earned money anymore. Moving on.',\n",

Whether this message reaches many or not, I’m sharing my direct experience. Amazon is undeniably convenient, fast, and easy to use, but it comes with serious risks, including fraud, financial theft, and receiving dangerous products. Using Amazon is like gambling with your money. I’ve had Amazon commit fraudulent transactions, charging me double and triple what I should have paid, which I had to sort out with my bank and they confirmed Amazon has been doing this to me. I’ve ordered a wide range of products from Amazon, and it's always a hit or miss regarding quality. I’ve even been hospitalized after receiving extremely foul food and drink products from Amazon. For instance, condiment sauces were so spoiled and contaminated that they nearly unalived me.I’ve encountered countless instances of products being falsely advertised and misrepresented by Amazon and its sellers—everything from grills and clothing to dolls, groceries, electronics, health items, automotive parts, sports gear and more. I’ve been defrauded multiple times over the years, with a recent example being defective and dysfunctional devices sold through numerous sellers. They just robbed me again of thousands of dollars for electronics. It’s clear that Amazon is aware of these issues because many others have been scammed in the same way. Amazon takes our money and delivers trash. Returning items is a hassle, and it's not always feasible for people.Amazon allows these fraudulent sellers to operate and benefits from their schemes. These sellers are slick, and anyone who has dealt with them knows what I’m talking about. The same applies to Amazon's customer service. It’s some kind of business model to take a bunch of money and provide devices that doesn’t work. This shouldn’t be legal. I’m not a legal expert, but this ongoing issue can’t be right.While I have received some good products from Amazon, the negative experiences far outweigh the positives. This is crazy.

       " 'Through out the years Amazon continues on its trend downwards. What blows my mind is that even with this disgusting rating I’m willing to bet many people here still purchase from Amazon. Which is why ratings some times are meaningless. Here is the issues:1. Prime shipping. Perfect for home delivery a freaking nightmare for apartment delivery. Plus their whole logistic side is ran by partners and has the lowest moral on earth. So basically every time you purchase something you’re asking an angry employee to take it deliver to you. Can you see why instructions aren’t followed and there is a high rate of shipping failures mostly to apartment buildings? 2. Through the years brand names became less and knocks became the focus. And to make sure you’re forced to go for the knock offs guess what they deeply discount the knock offs while keeping brand prices high. It’s a tactic that makes sure they always win and you lose. 3. Support is non existent. People found a way to get around it and escalate so they patch it back to the incompetent support team. People found another way to escalate they patched that too bringing it back to the same disgusting support team. So people found ways to reach their dispatch side to better track things. So Amazon again closed that off and forward the number to support. You could email the ceo directly to escalate that email doesn’t work anymore. Would could go to consumer protection or BBB or any other way short of a lawsuit it falls on death ears. Meaning they made it so the incompetent support team is your only communication to them. And to clarify I say incompetent because they don’t train the team or give them tools to resolve the issue. What we see on the app is the only information support is also given. 4. Decreased same day shipping. Majority of times if I need something it’s now labeled as a two day prime shipping. And the continue to decrease shipping through other carriers to the point it is almost strictly just prime shipping. And prime shipping is worthless. 5. The route items through warehouses that can be multiple hours away from you when they have warehouses next door to you. This pissed off drivers who then have no incentive to deliver your package on time. And if they run late even though you asked for same day your package will be 2 days late. 6. They don’t care about being customer based they are following the ways of every other tech company out there. Going from having an awesome reputation to no reputation at all. None. Or having the bottom of the barrel worst reputation ever. Point is Amazon has no incentive do lift a finger. They are just going to continue to push crap even with the federal government investigating them it still won’t do a thing for them. This is what happens when a company becomes too big without being regulated more strictly. They become dangerous and unstoppable. If you can find the item elsewhere I strongly suggest getting it there. For me tech needs I go to tech stores around the area. Sure higher prices but I don’t care. At least there is no headaches. I go in I grab the box of what I need I pay for it and that’s it. ',\n",

Just some highlights.We frequently get items that are different from their advertisements--and for the worse. Many items fail within the first few months, but when we look back at our order history to review the ad, the company that had offered the items is no longer on Amazon. Suspicious. We can\\'t trust Amazon reviews anymore. Lots of low quality foreign goods with 4.5 and 4.6 star reviews, but too many of these reviewed products we buy turn out to be trash that can\\'t even last 3-months. Whenever we write a positive review, Amazon publishes it without a hitch. But most of our negative reviews are flagged and removed, despite our not finding any justification for this in Amazon\\'s own review guidelines. No Amazon rep ever gets back to us to explain what\\'s up.Amazon\\'s customer service is unreliable. We\\'ve lost track of how many times a chat support agent has given us instructions and promised us we can trust them, but later it turns out they were wrong. And we have to bear the financial cost of THEIR wrong instructions. Even when issues are elevated to \"supervisors,\" we\\'ve been given false information that\\'s cost us money. Today, Amazon is often just unwilling to compensate customers hurt because of Amazon\\'s or Amazon\\'s reps\\' errors.About one in three items delivered to our home arrives damaged. So the gas we waste driving long distances to Amazon return drop off centers adds up. Why are we PAYING resources to return Amazon\\'s junk? No more.Amazon HAS WRONGLY CHARGED OUR CREDIT CARD for items we have proof were returned to Amazon because, so customer support supervisors have told us, this trillion-dollar company can\\'t keep track of its own shipping network.

Google it--several US state attorneys generals have taken or are taking legal action for Amazon wrongly charging customers for items that were timely and correctly returned.I could go on and on.

We also live a in time where security issues arise from time to time, particularly in urban areas.Theft can be a problem at any time but when deliveries are left unattended for any length of time, it\\'s a red wragg to a bull! I get that drivers are generally in a rush to get to the next delivery and are human, but these days there\\'s a  noticeable trend for couriers to often ignore instructions to wait until someone answers the door,drop the item on the doorstep and move on. One customer support person informed me that these are called \"unattended deliveries\" Genius.Reporting this to their Deliveries and Logistics department turned out to be a fruitless exercise (so please save yourself the time and hope). Despite assurances to look into the problem, the problem kept reoccurring, and bizarrely logistics kept on giving the same assurances. Its eternal loop!They may well investigate the problem, whilst it continues to happen but will claim, due to GDPR and to protect the drivers identity claimants are not allowed to know the outcome of the investigation in any way. Utter garbage.So you will never know if the problem has even been addressed and since it keeps happening, whatever efforts they may or may not of made, ultimately amount to nothing.

This was not true; the return request was cancelled automatically, and I had been in constant contact with customer service, who assured me it was being handled.This entire experience has been extremely frustrating and feels like a fraudulent practice.

I call BS I did a google search and found the corporate office phone numbers in less than a minute.  If I can do it, why don't they!

Then they claim it closed automatically due to inactivity. Only to have to resay everything you already said or make you log back in to try again. I am stern and direct but never curse or ask for inappropriate resolutions.  In fact, all I have ever asked for is my product to be delivered and give me a real date that I can expect delivery when promised. They will then tell you they are issuing a refund because the system gives them no other option and when the item arrives you can keep it.  All the while insisting it will be delivered. But then they go in and cancel the order ensuring you never receive it.  Not that it matters because even items I clearly told them I didn't want a refund never arrive and then I have to have another terrible interaction to get the refund because it never shows up.

The inability to cancel or receive a refund for the delivery fees adds to the frustration.Decision:Due to these ongoing issues, I have decided to cancel my Amazon subscription. The repeated failures in delivery and poor handling of these situations have led me to seek more reliable alternatives.Overall, this experience has been extremely disappointing, and I hope Amazon takes steps to improve its delivery services and customer support.But looking at all the previous reviews they never seem to read any of them so they will never learn how to improve.Sincerely,\",\n",

If it’s from a third-party seller you can’t take it to Staples  you have to take it to UPS. The UPS store is 25 minutes from me! Several months ago I had a problem with a wicker chair from a third-party seller. It was a complete nightmare… the seller canceled the order and I ordered somewhere else and then they delivered the chair anyway..it was an absolute nightmare trying to get it back to the seller UPS refused to pick it up and kept asking me for a tracking number and I said I don’t have the tracking number you give me the tracking number  it’s here it’s ready to be picked up and they just refused to pick it up. Amazon‘s A-Z guarantee is an absolute joke they don’t stand behind it. I probably spend five hours of my time on this chair and trying to return it. Eventually I charged it back on my bank credit card. My bank came down on my side. If all of that isn’t bad enough now they are requiring signatures and codes in order to deliver your packages. How can someone give a signature if they are at work so your package goes back-and-forth eventually you don’t get it at all and then you can try re-ordering it and hope that you’re home when they come by for your signature. I ordered items for my brother and they sent the code to me by the time I got it to my brother it was too late the driver had already been there they tried again to deliver and he wasn’t there and eventually all the items went back to amazon. Who in the world is running this company? I understand they arehaving problems with stolen packages but the solution is that the customer doesn’t get their package at all!!! so is it worst if its stolen or to have amazon take it back because they’re not able to get your signature or some code in order to leave your package.?

       " 'I have been shopping on amazon for years. I have spent thousands.  I have also been a big advocate for support brick and mortar stores even if you have to pay a lil more because stores like amazon will easily take consumers for granted. Use you to get there then work against you severely. Here is one such case. This is not the first mind you but years ago when I had a similar case they did help resolve it.So I put this review here because amazon is nortorious for not allowing your reviews against their best sellers or them to see the light of day.  There is zero reason why a place like amazon CANNOT protect your purchases for a extended period of time beyond 30 to 60 days..after 30 days because the items were small I just ignore bad items..take the hit..but on big ones this is bad.I purchased a solar generator for a VERY good price I knew would not come around again if I passed up that deal so I purchased it...it was such a great deal that I was going to purchase two but when I went back it was the last one and discontinued. Ok no biggie.  I didnt need to use it then. But knew in tbe near future I would with what I have been dealing with.So I got it nov. 11 of 2023. I just opened it to set it up last week of june 2024 when to my dismay the thing did not work at all...ony the charging part..no lights..no power receptacles worked nothing. I had video taped the whole unboxing because I was going to start uploading randon things to you tube.So I contacted Amazon...they said they contacted the seller successfully and I should hear from them within 48 hrs. Ok...nothing..two weeks so far nothing..so finally I called back amazon because they said if I didnt hear back and no resolution call them back so I did..ONLY for them to say there is nothing they can do..then I pressed a lil to say look this is a total loss I just opened it..the item was on sale at real low price you wouldnt find else where for a 1100 watt solar generator for 300 bucks...so the rep put me on hold and finally came back and said give VB direct 24 to 48 hrs to respond..so what it seems like if they dont respond I am sol.This is pretty bad I cannot imagine the yearly loss to customers because of Amzon policy. 30 days goes by in a flash especially with how our lives are consumed with various things. Its not unheard of for people to buy something they know they could later because they found it at a price they know just never happens or wont when they will need it.So what..only buy something you plan on using immediately? While nothing I am sure will come of this and this will be a 300.00 loss to me.There is no reason Amazon cannot provide solid purchase protection for people purchasing from their site. It a 30 day return policy stated...but they MAY.. with some persistance provide help up to 60 days.. not listed in their policy but a internal manegerial understanding from how it was conveyed..and that leniency is provided based soley on circumstance.Amazon could easily recover losses through insurance if not from the vendor on items solidly proven to have just been accessed by the buyer..and rightfully yes..only with solid proof like I have.. Add to policy for sellers that they are atleast responible for damaged item up to 190 days. And if the seller have stopped selling on Amazon before that time is up then selectively with solid proof from the buyer the item was just opened months after purchase.  Then insurance claim and favors the buyer.The buyer is what makes all company that provides a platform for sale of items or actually sell items...so this was a massive loss to me because of Amzon policy.

Customer service assured my wife that a replacement book would be sent free of charge and the original item did not need to be returned (sensible, given the costly logistics involved for them with international shipping). The replacement book arrived and was in the condition you would expect a new book to be.Fast forward about 3 weeks... I check my bank balance for no reason in particular and I see a charge from amazon.com. Now, I haven\\'t ordered from Amazon.com ever in my life, but I knew my wife had and asked if she had ordered something again and accidentally selected the wrong card (my card, which is linked as a \"household\" in our account settings).It turns out, no, she had not ordered anything from Amazon.com but, upon contacting their customer service, I was informed that they had charged MY bank account rather than the account used for the original order to claw back money for failing to return an item ---> an item THEY ASSURED US did not need to be returned!Then the circus really began as they forced us into the weirdest game of whack-a-mole I\\'ve ever encountered... They couldn\\'t talk to me about taking money out of my account because the order was in my wife\\'s account....And then told her they couldn\\'t talk to her about money coming out of my account because it was not in her name... Then they insisted we call a \"toll free number\" IN THE BLOODY USA (which is never going to be toll free when calling from the UK!!) and finally...after about 3-4 hours of both of us pushing and pushing and telling them there was no way we were getting on the phone because the cost of the phone call would be greater than the refund value, I FINALLY got confirmation that the refund would be issued.Then, I receive an email (sent twice...) stating that the refund would be \"issued in 3-5\", not days not weeks not hours, just \"in 3-5\"...But I figure I\\'ll wait and see... And what do you know? 17 days later... No refund! So now, I get to start the circus all over again because it has become a matter of principle at this point. This is no longer about $27 and change.

       " \"I started using Amazon back in the 1990s as a graduate student. I purchased my textbooks there as it was cheaper than the university bookstore and tax free. Fast forward to 2008 when Amazon asked me to try prime for free. I did. And didn't realize they charged me $79 for the membership. I decided to keep it because products were cheaper than at on-ground stores, no taxes and free shipping. Then in 2012 China clamped down on counterfeit producers and stopped them from selling product in China. In 2012 Amazon opened the door to these Chinese sellers and Amazon became flooded with a bunch of junk products. The price of prime kept rising, but I kept it because of Prime video and 2-day delivery. When I became sick I relied on Amazon more. Now Amazon is expensive. They have moved lots of shows to Freevee, which I don't watch because I don't do ad TV. And to add insult to injury this year, 2024, they started adding ads to Prime Video and demanding an extra $3/month to remove the ads, citing all of the other services they added to Prime. I don't use those other services, so it is bloatware to me. Stuff isn't being delivered in 2 days anymore. And there have been times when products were lost in their shipping facilities and not delivered. You call Amazon and they outsource their customer service overseas, these people have no way to contact the drivers. This is rubbish. The seller ALWAYS has contact with shipping! Paying extra for same-day delivery doesn't guarantee it will be delivered same-day. Amazon stopped packing cushioning in boxes so I've received items damaged. I've received spoiled food items. I was horrified to learn the tea I was drinking expired months before. Once they shipped me pet food meant to be sold in Mexico. So, even though you purchase from one seller they ship the product that is closer to your domicile, which might not be the same quality. Prices aren't cheaper than the on-ground store anymore, sometimes it is higher. Taxes are included too. So there is no value to having Amazon anymore. I even submitted my SSN & 1099 to sell t-shirts on Amazon. They stopped adding people to the program that didn't have a huge social media following. But refused to delete my information from their database. Lastly, I purchased a product that was defective, a sports watch. I wanted to exchange it. The watch cost hundreds of dollars. The customer service rep wanted to offer me $25 for it. I demanded a supervisor and the US support team processed the exchange. When Hurricane Beryl was bearing down on Houston TX, I ordered the Midland NOAA radio bundle so I could be notified of tornados and floods should I lose power. My home was hit by a tornado in May 2024, so the threat was real. I paid extra for same day delivery. Amazon split the bundle with one part being delivered in a week and the other same-day, except they never delivered it and promised to deliver it AFTER the hurricane. I called and spoke to three reps. One had a fake barking dog sound and you couldn't hear a word she said. After 30 minutes she just told me to call the number I called to get her. Another promised to expedite it. He didn't. Finally I canceled the delivery with the third person. The product was sitting in Houston, I'm in Houston. I don't know why they refused to deliver it. I had to eventually purchase it from another company. This company that started out well is not the same as it was in the past when it cared about its customers. It doesn't care about its employees nor customers now, it only cares about profit. I will not be renewing my prime membership in October. And I will shop other online and on-ground retailers.\",\n",

Unfortunately, there was no communication from Amazon so I initiated another phone call with the same info. Again, the same pseudo result occurred with no communication. After 6 phone calls and speaking to 2 supervisors I was told the “window for returning” the gift card was closed. Excuse me …. “What gift card? Oh, you mean the missing gift card which I have repeatedly been inquiring about and assured was under investigation?”Obviously, there will be no refund nor any explanation given for this problem. My next action will be to write to Amazon although I do not anticipate a response of any kind. When my Prime membership is due to renew in August 2024, I am finished with Amazon. Thanks but NO THANKS! ',\n",

I double checked the customs import duties, was assured it was correct, paid up front, was promised delivery by 16 July 2024 and guess what?... Yesterday I was informed that my LapTop was returned to sender because the tax/duties was incorrect. Thank you Amazon, I was really looking forward to receiving my product and now you will, undoubtedly, have me jumping through obstacles as you hang on to my money and refund in a few months on the premise that you have administrative checks. Shame on you for treating customers this way. Are you going to reimburse me for my loss of % on my bank account, bank charges, inconveince? No way as half the time you use stupid AI.  I tried to phone you in accordance with your helpline and got a message saying press 150 when I did it disconnected me. I repeated this 3 times with the same result. So much for your AI; it's rubbish at the expense of a human being losing their job, income and prospects. Dear Readers, my experience is horrible and causes loss and inconvenience. I would be very cautious in ordering anything expensive which includes import duties / taxes as Amazon's systems are lacking and I will now have lots of hassles and waiting for my refund.It's not  fair as when you order they demand split second payment, but when things go wrong, I am treated like I am at the back of a long queue and I wish I could give a zero star rating.J N STACHIW, SOLICITOR.27 July. This is an update. As predicted, Amazon wrote to me saying wait until 17 August and then contact them again! I presume this was an automated email as a subsequent and human email confirmed the parcel was being returned and payment would be made 5 days later. I asked if I would receive any compensation for loss of bank interest etc and this has been ignored. The conclusion here is that Amazon are now so big that they no longer have to worry about customer care as they did when they started. Commercially they can cut costs by forgetting about customer care and focusing on increasing profits. 20 August 2024Well I finally got my refund after a 6 week delay. This is horrendous as their policy is simply to make customers wait before they give a refund. I asked for compensation for my lost bank charges and their policy is to never compensate. They used to be good but now they are focused on profits with a massive middle finger to their customers. I actually proactively and one of hopefully many who will on principle NEVER use Amazon again.\",\n",

Recently I started buying Amazon gift cards to accumulate points on my credit cards. Also at times I was able to buy gift cards for a better deal than using my Amazon credit card which only offers 5% cashback on Amazon purchases.Amazon canceled some of my orders and said that my amazon.com gift cards are in violation of their gift card \"terms and conditions\". I called into Amazon and provided documentation showing that these gift cards were purchased legitimately from a third-party. I also showed credit card receipts to Amazon showing that I purchased these gift cards. In going through their terms and conditions I violated none of them. Also the customer service representatives that I spoke with admitted that this was flagged mistakenly as fraud because I purchased many gift cards and it was not my fault. They restored access to my account and credited the gift cards in question to my account.After this incident I thought that everything was fine. As usual I placed more orders on Amazon and they flagged four of my gift cards totaling $423. They accused me of these gift cards being fraudulent which they were not and closed my account. I provided Amazon with screenshots of gift card purchases and my credit card statement showing these gift cards were purchased legitimately but this just fell on deaf ears. Amazon claimed that I was in violation of their “conditions of use”. I went through their conditions of use multiple times and could not find any violation I was guilty of. I asked specifically what violation I was guilty of and never got a response.Let me reiterate that I have done nothing wrong except buy gift cards from someone other than Amazon. I provided documentation proving my innocence but this did not matter. Being a long time and loyal Amazon customer this really was upsetting. Amazon stole $423 in gift cards from me that I purchased legitimately, canceled my membership, and there is nothing that I can do about it. Any proof that I sent to Amazon was completely ignored. Unfortunately I thought Amazon was a better company than this but it seems that they are just a huge organization that really doesn\\'t care about their customers and will actually steal their hard earned money.This being said be very careful about purchasing Amazon gift cards from a third-party because Amazon may steal your money and close your account where you will have no repercussions whatsoever.

In addition to that their drivers insist on driving into my driveway and up to my gargage instead of parking on the street and walking up to the front door or garage door.  The driveway is narrow and there is insufficient room to turn their vehicles around to drive out in forward gear.  They must drive out in reverse, which many cannot do.  Consequently they have damaged my property by driving off the driveway and/or driving into the traffic cones and reflectors that I have placed along the driveway.  I more recently got a block to place at the end of the driveway to prevent them from driving in.  In response they began to leave packages at the driveway block which is about 8' from the street.  Packages have gotten wet and been snowed upon and hidden from view only to find damaged contents the next AM.

Better for themselves not for their customers. The reason that hundreds of thousands Amazon customers in North America and the UK have had it with Amazon is that it has lost it’s unique selling proposition that got it where it is today. Amazon used to be a seamless shopping experience, No More. Price points the same and higher than Brick and Mortar retail and other on line companieswith better delivery on time arrivals than Amazon.  Forget Prime for next day delivery that is also a has been that we pay for. An increased volume of subpar third party products with Zero warranty from both Amazon and the seller after thirty days. Proving that Amazon has approved the seller and the 30 day return window making Amazon an accessory to alleged fraud. All it says to the Amazon customer is buyer beware. Amazon customer service especially in situations like reporting a non functioning product a day after the 30 day window is closed is an hour long run around pre designed to run your through endless hoops without a resolution through attrition to get you off their backs and keep your money. Absolutely pathetic on Amazon. I have no intention of doing business with any corporation that has no real time respect for long time loyal customers, zero integrity and honesty, and are still desperate to make every penny they can get from us by hook or by crook to top of their Billions.

Anything to make more money, as if they did not have enough already, no matter what the harm to the customers may be. Unfortunately, they will continue to do what they do, and worse, because at the end we'll use Amazon again. These reviews are merely a way to blow out steam, and have the voice that Amazon routinely silences, but we are too used to the convenience of ordering something and receiving it the next day, so we are going to accept the bully....sad. \",\n",

However, my attempt to return the item has been an incredibly frustrating experience. The third-party seller refused to provide a return slip, leaving me at a loss for how to proceed.In an effort to resolve the issue, I reached out to Amazon customer service five times via chat and phone. During each interaction, I was assured that I would receive a refund within 48-72 hours. Unfortunately, these promises never materialized. On my final attempt to contact Amazon, I was shocked to learn that they were unsure why I had been repeatedly told I would receive a refund, as the item apparently cannot be returned. When I pointed out the 30-day return guarantee clearly stated on the website, I was told this information was incorrect.This experience has left me feeling misled and disappointed. As a Prime member, I expected better support in resolving this issue. Instead, I've wasted countless hours trying to address the problem, only to be told that Amazon cannot assist further. I'm now left with an unwanted product and over $300 out of pocket.This situation raises serious concerns about Amazon's policies regarding third-party sellers and their commitment to customer satisfaction. Why would Amazon allow third-party businesses on their platform if they cannot comply with Amazon's stated policies? Moreover, why isn't Amazon willing to work with customers and sellers to resolve disputes fairly? This system seems to open up opportunities for third-party sellers to potentially scam Amazon purchasers.I would appreciate if Amazon could clarify their policies regarding third-party sellers and returns, improve their customer service to provide accurate information, and implement better measures to ensure third-party sellers comply with Amazon's policies.
